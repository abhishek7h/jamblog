        I’m Abhishek. I live in Kerala, India. I like programming, writing,
        anime, reading, music, gaming and playing football. I’m currently a
        student with interest in law. I like Social Science and English, and I
        am planning to major in humanities. I’m crazy about tech, especially
        smartphones. I currently daily-drive an iPhone SE 2020 and a Lenovo
        ideapad Slim 5. I’ve also taught myself Python and took a game-dev
        course in JavaScript. I prefer coding in Python but I do enjoy vanilla
        web development. I’m trying to learn React to develop better apps. This
        blog was made with the JAM Stack.
