      <p>
        I like to cure my boredom by programming, reading, watching anime and
        listening to music (studying too, of course). I love writing articles on
        various niches, but I write mostly about self-help and tech. I also
        enjoy playing football.

        Below are some of my favourite articles, or you can go to the blog page
        to see my most recent posts.
