      <p>
        I like to cure my boredom by programming, reading, watching anime and
        listening to music (might as well include studying). I love writing
        articles on various niches, but mostly self-help and tech. I also enjoy
        playing football. Have fun reading my blog posts!

        Below are some of my favourite articles, or you can go to the blog page
        to see my most recent posts.
