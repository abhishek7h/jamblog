      <p>
        I like to cure my boredom by programming, reading, watching anime and
        listening to music (might as well include studying). I love writing
        articles on various niches, but mostly self-help and tech. I also enjoy
        playing football. Subscribe to my
        <a href="https://ahm3.substack.com">newsletter</a> and follow me on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/abhishek7h">Twitter</a> (More
        <a href="https://bento.me/ah3">here</a>). Have fun reading my articles!
