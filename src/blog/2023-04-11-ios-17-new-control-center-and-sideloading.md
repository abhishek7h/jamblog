As per Mark Gurman, iOS 17 is rumoured to have a control center refresh and support for sideloading and alternate app stores.

These are some of the most requested features by the community, and Apple might deliver them in their next WWDC.\

The control centre might be inspired by Android. The new one may feature horizontal sliders and the buttons might be moved. The control center might just be redesigned like that, anyway, it’s good to see it getting redesigned. It may take some time to get used to the new one though haha.

Now for sideloading, I’m very sceptical about this one, but Apple definitely had momentum about introducing sideloading a few years ago. This might very well change how iOS is used. Sideloading will introduce cracked versions of apps like Spotify mod apk and modded games. I’m just genuinely curious about how Apple is letting this one be, but hey, I’m not complaining. It’s useful to have sideloading for legal purposes. And alternate app stores too. So far as per I know only one exists, the AltStore.

You could jailbreak your iPhone if you really need modding and stuff if this doesn’t happen.

Well, fingers crossed that this might happen, but what Apple really needs to do is bring Type C to iPhone :(
