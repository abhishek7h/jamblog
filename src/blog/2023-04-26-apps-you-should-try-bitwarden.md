We are on so many platforms that require login credentials and it becomes a hassle to remember and keep note of all our passwords.

Enter password managers.

A password manager is an app dedicated to storing all of your login credentials. All you need is a master password, with which you can access your e-vault.

There are many good password managers, the top ones include 1password, LastPass, Dashlane etc.

All of these are great, except there is one problem: you need to get a subscription to access essential features like sync.

But, a free and underrated password manager I prefer isÂ [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

Bitwarden also has its paid versions, but in the free version itself, you can sync withÂ **unlimited**Â devices! This is great if you are logging in on various devices.

Bitwarden also has a browser extension, from which you can directly add passwords.

It also has autofill, so once you add credentials for a site, itâ€™ll automatically fill in the details for you when you click it.

It also features a password creator, where itâ€™ll create strong passwords and pass phrases for you.

Iâ€™m not affiliated with Bitwarden, this is just my appreciation. You can feel free to continue using your current password manager, those who donâ€™t have one already, can consider this their first.
