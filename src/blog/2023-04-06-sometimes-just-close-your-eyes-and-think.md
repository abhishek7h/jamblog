We live a busy life. Our days are swamped and tightly scheduled. Sometimes, we just forget to think of the small things. We overlook them. We realise this, yet we continue to ignore them and carry on with other activities.

I’m going to ask you to try this, it’s very effective:

When you are relaxing, just close your eyes and focus on your thoughts. Organise them. Talk with your mind and try to find answers to your problems.

This is a simple technique to feel yourself in the midst of this hectic life. Don’t forget who you are. Love yourself. Feel yourself. Think of what you did today. What you have to do. What you are going to do? Remember someone you like. Make time for them.

My grandpa always does this, and I do, and you should do too. This helps you to relax and even relieves your eye from stress.

Apart from this exercise, try to do the things that you like to do, and make time for them. I know we all are busy, whether it's school or work or anything at all. But that doesn’t mean we should give up what we like to do. We still should do what we like to do.

Doing something you like to do is therapy. For some people, reading is therapy. For others, it is listening to music, writing or just talking to a loved one. It’s therapy as long as you enjoy doing it and never regret it for the time it takes.
