Twitter has updated it’s ToS and renamed Twitter, Inc. to X Corp. It’ll be taking effect on May 18.

X Corp. sounds vaguely familiar to X.com, which was an online bank co-founded by Elon, which later became PayPal. But X Corp. and X.com are not at all the same. In fact, it’s a subsidiary of X Holdings Corp., which is owned by Elon.

Now, let's talk about Twitter Blue. You can get a blue checkmark for $8 a month. How cool. That’s ₹900 a month on iOS and Android and ₹650 on the web. Yes, it’s cheaper on the web because there’s no 30% tax. The biggest feature of Twitter Blue is reach. Subscribers will be ranked higher in replies and their tweets will be pushed higher by the algorithm. Not only that, you have rights to flex. Other than that, you can edit Tweets, get custom themes and custom app icons.

Next, Twitter recently launched Subscriptions in Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. You must have at least 500 followers, be active and be at least 18 years old. Account which setup Subscriptions can post exclusive Tweets that only subscribers can see. Many accounts have already set this up including Elon himself. Elon also subscribes to many people. Some controversy has sparked after Twitter has started recommending people to get subscriptions in their notifications. Twitter is trying to push accounts with subscriptions set up. Gives me flashbacks to when Twitter pushed Tweets with Space (Space is Twitter’s version of Clubhouse, audio only meetings where people can join and listen or speak) links that many people exploited. You could get like 300k-400k likes. Twitter had to start suspending accounts that exploited this.

Another little thing happened with Canada’s news channel’s Twitter account, (at)CBC. It had the label ‘Government-funded media’ (labels are short descriptions given to official accounts), which CBC argued that it funds 30% on it’s own, so it should not have the ‘Government-funded media’ label. Elon countered this argument by giving them the label ‘70% Government-funded media’ label. But then a user on Twitter said **"69% Give them the benefit of the doubt"**, to which Elon agreed and changed CBC’s label to ‘69% government-funded media’. CBC got so pissed that they paused activity on Twitter. I love this tea.
