So far in my life, I’ve had many experiences and encounters. I’ve had the realisation that I’ve learnt some lessons, whether it be through rough experiences or guidance from mentors. We all learn valuable pieces of information throughout our lives, in some way or the other. It’s our job to put one and one together and make something useful out of that information. Here’s what I’ve learnt:

### Patience is the key

This is one of the most important life lessons I’ve learnt, mostly even from experience. Whether it be something I’ve wanted, I wait. When I’m waiting for a result, that is even harder and tenser. The constant anxiousness of what’s going to happen, but I can’t just hack into the system and get the result, can I? I just have to wait and wait until I get it. The moment I have it, the patience pays off.

### Not everything goes the way you want

This lesson I’ve learnt mostly from various people guiding me in my life. My mother, father, grandparents, and teachers. Various people have taught me since a long time ago, it's not necessary that one should get what one wants immediately. The world does not revolve around one.

### Consistency is the key to success

This is very important, and I’ve learnt it from experience. Being consistent with anything can help you become a master of it. One example of this life lesson is me learning the Rubik’s Cube. I started thinking it was impossible. Then I started watching various tutorials until I found [one](https://youtu.be/7Ron6MN45LY) tutorial, which I watched over and over again, practising daily, even for hours on end sometimes. In maybe like 2 days since I started getting consistent with the Cube, I learnt how to solve it. I stayed consistent with practising it. I practised and practised and practised daily, dropping my time to solve it from over 5 minutes to less than 2 minutes.

### Not everything is perfect

Not everything is perfect or needs to go perfectly. I had an English exam for which I had worked super hard. I had hopes that I’ll score a 100 but I’d gotten 99. Still, though, I was happy with the result, but I was still dismayed, I was this close to getting 100 on a final exam. But eventually, I learnt that everything does not need to go perfectly. It’s alright if it's imperfect. Nothing is perfect. Everything has its flaws.

### Taking one for the greater good (here, team)

This one time, I went to play football (soccer). I was in the hopes that I’ll score goals for my team. But what happened? I couldn’t score any goals for my team as I was playing as a midfielder. My job was to control the field and make opportunities for my team to score, which I did. I couldn’t myself score, but I helped my team score, which in fact is the greater good here. Sometimes, taking one for your people when no one else does the right thing *is* the right thing to do.

### Small habits pay off in the long run

Having small habits will eventually pay off in the long run. This life lesson is inspired by books like [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), which is a great book I’ve gotta say. I’ve started to focus on the smaller things that we take for granted, like drinking water. In this busy life, we sometimes even forget to hydrate. I tend to drink water more often. Habits like taking a walk daily, are extremely beneficial. I know there will be eventual laziness and lack of motivation, but once you get the flow, it’ll become a routine in your life.

### Being nice to everyone

This here is the best advice I could offer to anyone. The most valuable life lesson I’ve personally learnt is being nice to everyone. Always say thank you to the cashier. Always wish the bus/taxi driver. Wish your teachers/mentors. Be kind to a stranger. Ask them how their day was. Show a sign of friendliness, and prove to them that kindness still exists even in the damned parts of this world. Being nice to someone can make their whole day or week. By everyone, I mean everyone. Even to those who hate you. Stay calm and cool however bad the situation is. I’ve written an article on dealing with hatred, check that out next.
