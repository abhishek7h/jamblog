If you’re in the need of a note-taking app, I’ve got you covered.

[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com)is a note-taking app and is just as it sounds; simple. It supports markdown and has real-time sync. It’s available on Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and even on browsers. It also features a tagging system where you can add tags to organise your notes.

What’s the best thing you ask? It’s completely free! You don’t see many apps with OS-wide support and sync, Simplenote is a 10/10 app that you should definitely try. I’m not affiliated with Simplenote, this post is just my appreciation.
