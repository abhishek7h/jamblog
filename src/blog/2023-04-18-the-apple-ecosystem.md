Hey,

Happy Sunday. Hope everyone is having a good day or night. Today, while thinking of topics, Starbucks came to my mind, especially the way they write their customer‚Äôs names (That‚Äôs for another issue, I suppose). I got another topic though, Apple‚Äôs Ecosystem. One of the best in class.

Slice of life: I was drinking tea while watching the fog covering the city of Madikeri, it was beautiful.

Read on!

Apple‚Äôs Ecosystem is phenomenal. The way the devices integrate is just fantastic engineering. You see, once you buy an iPhone, you might gradually buy a Mac, or AirPods, or perhaps an Apple Watch. You might gradually own all of these at one point, that‚Äôs when you have an Apple Ecosystem. The workflow you get on them is insane. For example, you could Airdrop an image from your iPhone to your Mac, edit it there and Airdrop it back. You can make insane workflows like that. 



Apple really puts in work to their Ecosystem and makes it so that you‚Äôll own everything Apple. 

Now, if we take the average consumer, it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll own everything Apple. And there are people like me, who use iPhone but use a Windows/Linux desktop. For the Windows users, there‚Äôs Intel Unison. It‚Äôs this app that lets you send texts and make calls from your PC once you connect your iPhone. It‚Äôll allow to replicate the iPhone-Mac integration.

Even if you just use an iPhone and Apple Watch, it‚Äôs still a sort of mini-Ecosystem. You can send replies, check emails, track your calories and all from your wrist. Now add AirPods to that. Even better. 

To be honest, you can just use cheaper Earbuds as a replacement for AirPods. I personally use realme Buds Air 2, and they work great.  

Now, you can integrate Apple with your home as well. You could use a HomePod, Siri in a box, could answer all your questions and fulfil your tasks. With an impressive speaker, you could blast to your favourite tunes.

Take it to the big screen with Apple TV. Amazing integrations with iPhone and other devices. Watch shows from every platform and play games with Apple Arcade. 

Apple Homekit accessories like bulbs and Ring Doorbell cameras can be accessed with Siri or from Apple‚Äôs home app. 

Now to dig in further, Apple‚Äôs native apps. With subscriptions, there is Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade , iCloud+, News+ and Fitness+. You get them all bundled in Apple One for $16.95/m and ‚Çπ195/m in India (without News+ and Fitness+, as they are not available in India). 

Then we have iMessage and FaceTime, essential for communication between iOS users. These, however, are only widely used in the US.

Personally, I think the Apple Ecosystem is well made. If you‚Äôre at a point where you have every Apple device ever, there‚Äôs no going back.

I‚Äôm not biased towards Apple, I‚Äôm just a fan. This is just my appreciation towards Apple‚Äôs Ecosystem.
